# My YouTube channel has been removed from the site recently for supposed "Spam, scams or commercially deceptive content": I have made an appeal and am awaiting a response. UPDATE: I have received a response but YouTube insists that my channel has broke their Terms of Service. I will continue to push them until I get my channel back.

# What is this?

This is a collection of music playlists I have made.

I usually want a single conductor with a single orchestra conducting a cycle of works in the same genre by the same conductor. For example, Ludwig van Beethoven's 9 symphonies conducted by Herbert von Karajan with the Berlin Philharmonic would form a playlist. Usually I'd want the same soloist(s) too, but there will be times where this is not possible.

The file structure and what you can find is shown below.

## FAQ
* Why are there some playlists that are partially complete/empty?
    * This is because YouTube occasionally removes their own auto-generated videos for some reason. I would fix it, but I don't revisit my playlists all the time due to the sheer amount of them there are.
